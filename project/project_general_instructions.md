# Project Instructions Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing 2023

This project will be the total of your final grade. I expect that you invest time to prepare it.

## Important Dates

1. Before February 14st, 8:00 pm: Register
   here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13jmRCWlw7yyUyu5CDePeLeHr4Dfggd9iJziBRXOQDEY/edit?usp=sharing

2. By Saturday, March 18th, 8:00 am: Share the final paper (on overleaf) with us for review.

3. By Monday, March 20th : We will share with you our feedback, incoporate it and submit your paper, with code link
   on [Openreview](https://openreview.net/).

4. By Saturday, March 24th: your paper should be upload openreview. Share the link with us for the final grade.

NB: For each team, I expect one mail confirming that you did each step of the process with your partner as CC.

Note: I gave you 3 extract week. If you do miss one deadline you will fail the exam (grade will be below 10).

## Instruction:

### General Instructions:

In pairs, you are asked to choose a task from the proposed problems (see the 4 project proposals) and implement and
reproduce baselines on one or more datasets. Each project has been chosen because I think the topic is "hot" and is
currently an open research question in the community.

You are then ask to produce a 4 pages (main content with unlimited appendix) research paper. This corresponds to the
short format of ACL paper. Template can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ntnrhfpqcghm).

To be able to reuse this project as a reference project in your "future" carrier. I ask you to publish your paper
on [Openreview](https://openreview.net/)
but only after I peered review it! This is the main reason of the double deadline.

### Evaluation:

For every rule violation, you will lose points (a lot). Be on time for your work. There will be a large number of groups
and we will spend a lot of time giving you valuable feedback, so please keep our commitment.

Specifically, we will evaluate:

1. Is the first version of the project complete (soundness, mathematical correctness)
2. Have you integrated the feedback we gave you?
3. How good is your code?
4. How original are your findings?

This project is quite open, I expect you to use your common sens when it comes to what is allowed and what is not.

#### Note:

I hope this project will also be used for your future job interview. You are not only working for the class but also for
your future job.

##### Tools:

For many of you, this will be your first research assignment. Don't try to reinvent the wheel! Build on what already
exists. Use grammarly, deepL, ChatGPT but you must write decent English!
